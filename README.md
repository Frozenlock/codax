# codax

Codax is an idiomatic transactional disk-based datastore for clojure. A codax database functions as a single (potentially enormous) clojure map, with a similar access & modification api.

### ACID Compliance

Codax provides the following guarantees:

  - **Atomic** - Every transaction is completed fully, or not at all
  - **Consistent** - The database always represents a valid clojure map
  - **Isolated** - No reader or writer will ever see data from an incomplete transaction
  - **Durable** - All writes are synced to disk before returning

## Installation

```clojure
[codax "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Usage

### Basic API

**Database Functions**

  - `open-database` - Opens or creates a database
  - `close-database` - Closes an open database

**Transaction Macros**
These take a database argument and a transaction-symbol and bind the symbol to a newly created transaction. Transactions are isolated from each other. Read-transactions evaluate to the value of their body, but a (successful) **write-transaction evaluates to nil**.

  - `with-read-transaction` - creates a read transaction
  - `with-write-transaction` - creates a write transaction (body must evaluate to a transaction or an exception will be thrown)

**Transactional Functions**
These are all similar to the clojure.core map `*-in` (e.g. `assoc-in`) with the following exceptions:
  - their first argument is a **transaction* instead of a map
  - their second argument is a **path** (see below)
  - their value argument or result (in the case of update) must be **conformant** (see below)

These must be called within a `with-write-transaction` or a `with-read-transaction` expression. Changes will only persisent if `with-write-transaction` is used.

  - `get-at`
  - `assoc-at`
  - `update-at`
  - `merge-at`
  - `dissoc-at`

**Direct Functions**
These are the same as the transactional-functions except that their first argument is a **database** instead of a **transaction**.

  - `get-at!`
  - `assoc-at!`
  - `update-at!`
  - `merge-at!`
  - `dissoc-at!`

### Paths
A `path` is a vector of keys similar to the `[k & ks]` used in function like `assoc-in` with a few exceptions

 - they are **limited to the following types**:
   - Symbols
   - Keywords
   - Strings
   - Numbers (float/double use is _strongly discouraged_)
   - true
   - false
   - nil
   - org.joda.time.DateTime
 - the path can only target nested maps, and **cannot be used to descend into other data structures (e.g. arrays)**.
 - you can get the empty path (e.g. `(get-at db [])` returns the full database) but you cannot modify it (e.g. `(assoc-at [] :foo)` throws an error)

### Conformant Values

- non-map values of any type serializable by [nippy](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy)
- maps and nested maps whose **keys conform to the valid path types** listed above.

## Examples

``` clojure
(require [codax.core :as c])
```

### Direct Database Use
``` clojure

(def db (open-database "data/my-database")) ;

(assoc-at! db [:assets :people] {0 {:name "Alice"
									:occupation "Programmer"
									:age 42}
								 1 {:name "Bob"
									:occupation "Writer"
									:age 27}}) ; nil

(get-at! db [:assets :people 0]) ; {:name "Alice" :occupation "Programmer" :age 42}

(update-at! db [:assets :people 1 :age] inc) ; nil

(merge-at! db [:assets] {:tools {"hammer" true
								 "keyboard" true}}) ; nil

(get-at! db [:assets])
;;{:people {0 {:name "Alice"
;;             :occupation "Programmer"
;;             :age 42}
;;          1 {:name "Bob"
;;             :occupation "Writer"
;;             :age 27}}
;; :tools {"hammer" true
;;         "keyboard" true}}


(close-database db)
```

### Transaction Use

``` clojure
(def db (open-database "data-my-database"))





```

## Performance

Codax is geared towards read-heavy workloads.

  - Read-Transactions block _nothing_
  - Write-Transactions block other Write-Transactions
  - Stage-1 Compaction blocks Write-Transactions (slow)
  - Stage-2 Compaction blocks both Reader-Transactions and Write-Transactions (fast)


Benchmark Taken Jan 14, 1017:
The following figures are for a database populated with 16,000,000 (map-leaf) values running on a Digital Ocean 2-core 2GB RAM instance. The write transactions have an average "path" length of 6 and an average 7 leaf values.

* ~320 write-transaction/second
* ~1640 read-transactions/second
* ~2700ms per compaction (compaction happens automatically every 10,000 writes)

These values come from running the `codax.bench.performace/run-benchmark` benchmarking function without arguments 3 times consecutively.
